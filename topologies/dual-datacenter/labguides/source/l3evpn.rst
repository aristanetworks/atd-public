.. note:: 
   
   This lab exercise is focused on the VXLAN EVPN configuration. IP addresses, MLAG and BGP Underlay are already configured.

1. Log into the  **LabAccess**  jumpserver:

   a. Type ``97`` to access additional lab, then ``evpn-labs`` at the prompt to access the EVPN VXLAN content. Then type ``l3evpn`` for the Layer 3 EVPN lab. 
   The script will configure the datacenter with the exception of **s1-leaf4**.

      .. note::
         
         Did you know the “l3evpn” script is composed of Python code that
         uses the CloudVision Portal REST API to automate the provisioning of
         CVP Configlets. The configlets that are configured via the REST API
         are ``L2EVPN_s1-spine1``, ``L2EVPN_s1-spine2``, ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf1``,
         ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf2``, ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf3``, ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf4``.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, check if Multi-Agent Routing Protocols are enabled.

   .. note::
      
      By default, EOS is using the GateD routing process. Activating (ArBGP) is requiring a reboot. This has been done prior to the lab buildout 
      so no reboot is required here.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, check the following operational states before configuring EVPN constructs:

   a. Verify EOS MLAG operational details.

      .. note::
         
         The MLAG state between **s1-leaf4** and its peer **s1-leaf3** will be inconsistent. This is expected as 
         **s1-leaf3** is fully configured and **s1-leaf4** is not as of yet.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, configure the BGP EVPN control-plane.
   
   a. Configure the EVPN control plane.

      .. note::

         In this lab, the Spines serve as EVPN Route Servers. They receive the EVPN Routes from 
         each leaf and, due to our eBGP setup, will naturally pass them along the other leaves.

         Also note that BGP standard and extended communities are explicitly enabled on the peering. EVPN makes 
         use of extended BGP communities for route signaling and standard communities allow for various other 
         functions such as BGP maintenance mode.
         
         Lastly, note in this setup we use eBGP-multihop peerings with the Loopback0 interfaces of each switch. 
         This follows Arista best-practice designs for separation of Underlay (peerings done using physical 
         Ethernet interfaces) and Overlay (peerings done using Loopbacks) when leveraging eBGP. Other options 
         exist and can be discussed with your Arista SE.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, configure the VXLAN data-plane for transport.

   a. Configure Loopback1 with the shared IP of **s1-leaf3**.

      .. note::

         This is referred to as an MLAG VTEP. The MLAG peer leafs provide redundancy by sharing the 
         Loopback1 IP and jointly advertising reachability for it. Route redistribution has already 
         been configured for the underlay.

      .. code-block:: text
      
         interface Loopback1
            description VTEP
            ip address 10.111.253.3/32

   #. Configure the Vxlan1 interface with the Loopback1 as the source.

      .. note::

         This is the logical interface that will provide VXLAN header encap and decap functions. In this 
         lab, since we are leveraging VXLAN routing, we can able the use of a virtual-router MAC address. 
         This instructs the device to use the shared MLAG System ID as the router MAC when performing VXLAN 
         routing operations and ensures that whichever switch in the MLAG receives the VXLAN Routed packet 
         can provide forwarding of that traffic without shunting it over the MLAG peer-link.

   #. Create the VRF, or logical routing instance, for the Tenant Layer 3 Network.

      .. note::

         In EOS, by default, VRFs are created with inter-subnet routing disabled.  Always be sure 
         to enable IP routing in user-defined VRFs.

      .. code-block:: text

         !
         ip routing vrf TENANT

   #. Create the SVI for default gateway function for the host network as an Anycast Gateway.

      .. note::

         With VXLAN, we can leverage a shared IP using Anycast Gateway. This allows a single IP 
         to be shared without any other dedicated IPs per switch.

      .. code-block:: text

            ip address virtual 10.111.134.1/24

   #. Map the local Layer 3 VRF with a matching VNI.

      .. note::

         For the Layer 3 Service, the VRF requires what is referred to as the Layer 3 VNI, which is used for VXLAN 
         Routing in a Symmetric IRB deployment between VTEPs. Any unique ID number will serve here.
   
      .. code-block:: text

         interface Vxlan1
            vxlan vrf TENANT vni 5001

   #. Add the IP VRF EVPN configuration for the TENANT VRF.

      .. note::

         Here we configure a Layer 3 VRF service with EVPN. It has two components. The first is a 
         route-distinguisher, or **RD** to identify the router (or leaf switch) that is originating the EVPN 
         routes. This can be manually defined in the format of **Number** : **Number**, such as 
         **Loopback0** : **VRF ID** or as we do in this case, let EOS automatically allocate one. The Auto RD 
         function is enabled globally for all VRFs under the BGP process.

         Second is the route-target, or **RT**. The **RT** is used by the leaf switches
         in the network to determine if they should import the advertised route into their local 
         table(s). If they receive an EVPN route, they check the **RT** value and see if they have a matching 
         **RT** configured in BGP. If they do, they import the route into the associated VRF. 
         If they do not, they ignore the route.

#. With the Layer 3 EVPN Service configured, verify the operational state.

   a. Check the VXLAN data-plane configuration.

      .. note::

         Here we can see some useful commands for VXLAN verification. ``show vxlan config-sanity detail`` 
         verifies a number of standard things locally and with the MLAG peer to ensure all basic criteria are 
         met.  ``show interfaces Vxlan1`` provides a consolidated series of outputs of operational VXLAN data such 
         as control-plane mode (EVPN in this case), VRF to VNI mappings and MLAG Router MAC.

   #. On **s1-leaf1** (and/or **s1-leaf2**) verify the BGP and Route table to ensure the Tenant network on **s1-leaf4** has been learned in the overlay.

      .. note::

         The output below shows learned **IP Prefix** routes from EVPN. These are referred to as EVPN Type 5 routes. 
         Other leaves receive this route, evaluate the **RT** to see if they have a matching 
         configuration and, if so, import the contained prefix into their VRF Route Table. Note that IPv4 and IPv6 
         are supported.

         Note on the route table for the TENANT VRF, we see a single route entry for the remote tenant subnet. 
         This route is directed to the shared MLAG VTEP IP and Router MAC. It will be ECMPed via the Spines providing 
         a dual path for load-balancing and redundancy.

   #. On **s1-leaf1**, check the local MAC address-table and ARP Table.

      .. note::

         The MAC addresses in your lab may differ as they are randomly generated during the lab build. We see here that 
         the ARP and MAC of **s1-host1** has been learned locally **s1-leaf1**. We also see the remote MAC for the shared 
         MLAG System ID of **s1-leaf3** and **s1-leaf4** associated with VLAN 4092 and the Vxlan1 interface. This is how 
         the local VTEP knows where to send routed traffic when destined to the remote MLAG pair. We can see this VLAN is 
         dynamically created in the VLAN database and is mapped to our Layer 3 VNI (5001) in our VXLAN interface output. 
         **Be aware that since this VLAN is dynamic, the ID used in your lab may be different.**
         
         Since we are using VXLAN ONLY for Layer 3 VRF services and not extending any local VLANs, **s1-host2**'s MAC 
         and ARP are not learned. It is reached via the IP Prefix route only.
