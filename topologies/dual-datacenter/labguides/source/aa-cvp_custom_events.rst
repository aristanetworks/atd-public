CloudVision Custom Events
==========================
Using the EOS Syslog function, and CVP Custom Events, 
CVP users can trigger custom events of any severity. 
This can be by creating a regular expression, or regex to detect 
and match an occurring log message. Or this log could be triggered by an EOS Event-Handler.
In this lab we will use the EOS CLI to send log messages that CVP will detect and create an Event accordingly.
