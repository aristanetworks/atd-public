.. note:: 
   
   This lab exercise is focused on the VXLAN EVPN configuration. IP addresses, MLAG and BGP Underlay are already configured.

1. Log into the  **LabAccess**  jumpserver:

   a. Type ``97`` to access additional lab, then ``evpn-labs`` at the prompt to access the EVPN VXLAN content. Then type ``l2evpn`` for the Layer 2 EVPN lab. 
   The script will configure the datacenter with the exception of **s1-leaf4**.

      .. note::
         
         Did you know the “l2evpn” script is composed of Python code that
         uses the CloudVision Portal REST API to automate the provisioning of
         CVP Configlets. The configlets that are configured via the REST API
         are ``L2EVPN_s1-spine1``, ``L2EVPN_s1-spine2``, ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf1``,
         ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf2``, ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf3``, ``L2EVPN_s1-leaf4``.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, check if Multi-Agent Routing Protocols are enabled.

   .. note::
      
      By default, EOS is using the GateD routing process. Activating (ArBGP) is requiring a reboot. This has been done prior to the lab buildout 
      so no reboot is required here.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, check the following operational states before configuring EVPN constructs:

   a. Verify EOS MLAG operational details.

      .. note::
         
         The MLAG state between **s1-leaf4** and its peer **s1-leaf3** will be inconsistent. This is expected as 
         **s1-leaf3** is fully configured and **s1-leaf4** is not as of yet.

   #. Verify BGP operational details for Underlay:

#. On **s1-leaf4**, configure the BGP EVPN control-plane.
   
   a. Configure the EVPN control plane.

      .. note::

         In this lab, the Spines serve as EVPN Route Servers. They receive the EVPN Routes from 
         each leaf and, due to our eBGP setup, will naturally pass them along the other leaves.

         Also note that BGP standard and extended communities are explicitly enabled on the peering. EVPN makes 
         use of extended BGP communities for route signaling and standard communities allow for various other 
         functions such as BGP maintenance mode.
         
         Lastly, note in this setup we use eBGP-multihop peerings with the Loopback0 interfaces of each switch. 
         This follows Arista best-practice designs for separation of Underlay (peerings done using physical 
         Ethernet interfaces) and Overlay (peerings done using Loopbacks) when leveraging eBGP. Other options 
         exist and can be discussed with your Arista SE.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, configure the VXLAN data-plane for transport.

   a. Configure Loopback1 with the shared IP of **s1-leaf3**.

      .. note::

         This is referred to as an MLAG VTEP. The MLAG peer leafs provide redundancy by sharing the 
         Loopback1 IP and jointly advertising reachability for it. Route redistribution has already 
         been configured for the underlay.

         This is the logical interface that will provide VXLAN header encap and decap functions.

#. Configure a Layer 2 EVPN service on **s1-leaf4**.

      .. code-block:: text

         vlan 112
            name Host_Network_112

   #. Map the local Layer 2 VLAN with a matching VNI.

      .. note::

         This is how the switch understands which local Layer 2 VLAN maps to which VNI in the overlay. The 
         example shows matching them one to one, but any scheme or method is valid, such as adding 10000 to 
         the VLAN ID.
   
      .. code-block:: text

         interface Vxlan1
            vxlan vlan 112 vni 112

   #. Add the mac-vrf EVPN configuration for VLAN 112.

      .. note::

         Here we configure a VLAN-based service with EVPN. It has two components. The first is a 
         route-distinguisher, or **RD** to identify the router (or leaf switch) that is originating the EVPN 
         routes. This can be manually defined in the format of **Number** : **Number**, such as 
         **Loopback0** : **VLAN ID** or as we do in this case, let EOS automatically allocate one.

         Second is the route-target, or **RT**. The **RT** is used by the leaf switches
         in the network to determine if they should import the advertised route into their local 
         table(s). If they receive an EVPN route, they check the **RT** value and see if they have a matching 
         **RT** configured in BGP. If they do, they import the route into the associated mac-vrf (or VLAN). 
         If they do not, they ignore the route.

#. With the Layer 2 EVPN Service configured, verify the operational state.

   a. Check the VXLAN data-plane configuration.

      .. note::

         Here we can see some useful commands for VXLAN verification. ``show vxlan config-sanity detail`` 
         verifies a number of standard things locally and with the MLAG peer to ensure all basic criteria are 
         met.  ``show interfaces Vxlan1`` provides a consolidated series of outputs of operational VXLAN data such 
         as control-plane mode (EVPN in this case), VLAN to VNI mappings and discovered VTEPs.

         The Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag, or **IMET**, route is how a VTEP advertises membership in a given Layer 2 
         service, or VXLAN segment.  This is also known as the EVPN Type 3 Route. Other leaves receive this route, 
         evaluate the **RT** to see if they have a matching configuration and, if so, import the advertising VTEP 
         into their flood list for BUM traffic.

         We see the MAC of **s1-host2** multiple times in the control-plane due to our redundant MLAG and 
         ECMP design. Both **s1-leaf3** and **s1-leaf4** are attached to **s1-host2** and therefore will 
         generate this Type 2 EVPN route for its MAC. They each then send this route up to the redundant 
         Spines (or EVPN Route Servers) which provides an ECMP path to the host.

   #. On **s1-leaf1**, check the VXLAN data-plane for MAC address.

      .. note::

         Though both **s1-leaf3** and **s1-leaf4** are advertising the MAC of **s1-host2** recall that 
         they have a shared MLAG VTEP IP for VXLAN reachability. Therefore we only see one possible 
         destination for this host MAC. The ``show l2rib output mac <MAC of remote host>`` command then 
         allows us to see the VTEP info in the hardware.  Finally we can verify the ECMP path to the remote 
         MLAG VTEP via **s1-spine1** and **s1-spine2** with a simple ``show ip route 10.111.253.3`` command.
