.. note:: 
   
   This lab exercise is focused on the VXLAN EVPN configuration. IP addresses, MLAG and BGP Underlay are already configured.

1. Log into the  **LabAccess**  jumpserver:

   a. Type ``97`` to access additional lab, then ``evpn-labs`` at the prompt to access the EVPN VXLAN content. Then type ``l2l3evpn`` for the Layer 2 and 3 EVPN lab. 
   The script will configure the datacenter with the exception of **s1-leaf4**.

      .. note::

         Did you know the “l2l3evpn” script is composed of Python code that
         uses the CloudVision Portal REST API to automate the provisioning of
         CVP Configlets. The configlets that are configured via the REST API
         are ``L2L3EVPN_s1-spine1``, ``L2L3EVPN_s1-spine2``, ``L2L3EVPN_s1-leaf1``,
         ``L2L3EVPN_s1-leaf2``, ``L2L3EVPN_s1-leaf3``, ``L2L3EVPN_s1-leaf4``.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, check if Multi-Agent Routing Protocols are enabled.

   .. note::
      
      By default, EOS is using the GateD routing process. Activating (ArBGP) is requiring a reboot. This has been done prior to the lab buildout 
      so no reboot is required here.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, check the following operational states before configuring EVPN constructs:

   a. Verify EOS MLAG operational details.

      .. note::
         
         The MLAG state between **s1-leaf4** and its peer **s1-leaf3** will be inconsistent. This is expected as 
         **s1-leaf3** is fully configured and **s1-leaf4** is not as of yet.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, configure the BGP EVPN control-plane.
   
   a. Configure the EVPN control plane.

      .. note::

         In this lab, the Spines serve as EVPN Route Servers. They receive the EVPN Routes from 
         each leaf and, due to our eBGP setup, will naturally pass them along the other leaves.

         Also note that BGP standard and extended communities are explicitly enabled on the peering. EVPN makes 
         use of extended BGP communities for route signaling and standard communities allow for various other 
         functions such as BGP maintenance mode.
         
         Lastly, note in this setup we use eBGP-multihop peerings with the Loopback0 interfaces of each switch. 
         This follows Arista best-practice designs for separation of Underlay (peerings done using physical 
         Ethernet interfaces) and Overlay (peerings done using Loopbacks) when leveraging eBGP. Other options 
         exist and can be discussed with your Arista SE.

#. On **s1-leaf4**, configure the VXLAN data-plane for transport.

   a. Configure Loopback1 with the shared IP of **s1-leaf3**.

      .. note::

         This is referred to as an MLAG VTEP. The MLAG peer leafs provide redundancy by sharing the 
         Loopback1 IP and jointly advertising reachability for it. Route redistribution has already 
         been configured for the underlay.

      .. code-block:: text
      
         interface Loopback1
            description VTEP
            ip address 10.111.253.3/32

   #. Configure the Vxlan1 interface with the Loopback1 as the source.

      .. note::

         This is the logical interface that will provide VXLAN header encap and decap functions. In this 
         lab, since we are leveraging VXLAN routing, we can able the use of a virtual-router MAC address. 
         This instructs the device to use the shared MLAG System ID as the router MAC when performing VXLAN 
         routing operations and ensures that whichever switch in the MLAG receives the VXLAN Routed packet 
         can provide forwarding of that traffic without shunting it over the MLAG peer-link.

#. Configure Layer 2 EVPN services on **s1-leaf4**.

   a. Add the local Layer 2 VLANs with an IDs of 112 and 134.

      .. code-block:: text

         vlan 112
            name Host_Network_112
         !
         vlan 134
            name Host_Network_134

   #. Map the local Layer 2 VLANs with a matching VNIs.

      .. note::

         This is how the switch understands which local Layer 2 VLAN maps to which VNI in the overlay. The 
         example shows matching them one to one, but any scheme or method is valid, such as adding 10000 to 
         the VLAN ID.
   
      .. code-block:: text

         interface Vxlan1
            vxlan vlan 112 vni 112
            vxlan vlan 134 vni 134

   #. Add the mac-vrf EVPN configuration for VLAN 112 and 134.

      .. note::

         Here we configure a VLAN-based service with EVPN. It has two components. The first is a 
         route-distinguisher, or **RD** to identify the router (or leaf switch) that is originating the EVPN 
         routes. This can be manually defined in the format of **Number** : **Number**, such as 
         **Loopback0** : **VLAN ID** or as we do in this case, let EOS automatically allocate one.

         Second is the route-target, or **RT**. The **RT** is used by the leaf switches
         in the network to determine if they should import the advertised route into their local 
         table(s). If they receive an EVPN route, they check the **RT** value and see if they have a matching 
         **RT** configured in BGP. If they do, they import the route into the associated mac-vrf (or VLAN). 
         If they do not, they ignore the route.

      .. code-block:: text

         router bgp 65102
            !
            vlan 112

               redistribute learned

#. Configure Layer 3 EVPN services on **s1-leaf4**.

   a. Create the VRF, or logical routing instance, for the Tenant Layer 3 Network.

      .. note::

         In EOS, by default, VRFs are created with inter-subnet routing disabled.  Always be sure 
         to enable IP routing in user-defined VRFs.

      .. code-block:: text

         vrf instance TENANT
         !
         ip routing vrf TENANT

   #. Create the SVI for default gateway function for the host network as an Anycast Gateway.

      .. note::

         With VXLAN, we can leverage a shared IP using Anycast Gateway. This allows a single IP 
         to be shared without any other dedicated IPs per switch.

      .. code-block:: text

         ip virtual-router mac-address 00:1C:73:00:00:01
         !
         interface Vlan112
            description Host Network 112
            vrf TENANT
            ip address virtual 10.111.112.1/24
         !
         interface Vlan134
            description Host Network 134
            vrf TENANT
            ip address virtual 10.111.134.1/24

   #. Map the local Layer 3 VRF with a matching VNI.

      .. note::

         For the Layer 3 Service, the VRF requires what is referred to as the Layer 3 VNI, which is used for VXLAN 
         Routing in a Symmetric IRB deployment between VTEPs. Any unique ID number will serve here.
   
      .. code-block:: text

         interface Vxlan1
            vxlan vrf TENANT vni 5001

   #. Add the IP VRF EVPN configuration for the TENANT VRF.

      .. note::

         Here we configure a Layer 3 VRF service with EVPN. It also leverage a unique **RD** and  **RT**. 
         They are used by the leaf switches for the same purpose as the Layer 2 service. The difference is simply 
         the routes are imported. If they receive a Type 5 EVPN route, they check the **RT** value and see if they have a 
         matching **RT** configured for the VRF. If so, they import the route into the associated VRF routing table. 
         If they do not, they ignore the route.

   a. Check the VXLAN data-plane configuration.

      .. note::

         Here we can see some useful commands for VXLAN verification. ``show vxlan config-sanity detail`` 
         verifies a number of standard things locally and with the MLAG peer to ensure all basic criteria are 
         met.  ``show interfaces Vxlan1`` provides a consolidated series of outputs of operational VXLAN data such 
         as control-plane mode (EVPN in this case), VLAN to VNI mappings and discovered VTEPs.

   #. On **s1-leaf1** (and/or **s1-leaf2**) verify the IMET table to ensure **s1-leaf4** has been discovered in the overlay.

      .. note::

         The Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag, or **IMET**, route is how a VTEP advertises membership in a given Layer 2 
         service, or VXLAN segment.  This is also known as the EVPN Type 3 Route. Other leaves receive this route, 
         evaluate the **RT** to see if they have a matching configuration and, if so, import the advertising VTEP 
         into their flood list for BUM traffic. Note that these are done on a per VLAN basis based on the MAC-VRF 
         configuration. Highlighted below are the EVPN Type 3 Routes from **s1-leaf4** which we identify based on 
         the **RD** value. The detail outputs show **RT** and **VNI** information as well as the **Tunnel ID** which 
         in our case is the VTEP address to flood BUM traffic to.

   #. On **s1-leaf1**, check the EVPN control-plane for the associated host MAC/IP.

      .. note::

         We see the MAC of **s1-host2** multiple times in the control-plane due to our redundant MLAG and 
         ECMP design. Both **s1-leaf3** and **s1-leaf4** are attached to **s1-host2** in VLANs 112 and 134 
         and therefore will generate these Type 2 EVPN route for its MAC. They each then send this route up to 
         the redundant Spines (or EVPN Route Servers) which provides an ECMP path to the host. The highlighting 
         below is focusing on **s1-leaf4**.

         Also notice that since we have configured our network for VXLAN Routing functionality we also see 
         the host MAC-IP route that advertises the ARP binding of **s1-host2**. By looking at the detailed output 
         of the command specifically for the host in VNI (VLAN) 112, we can see details about the **RT** and **VNIs**, 
         both Layer 2 (112) and Layer 3 (5001) which we see in further outputs later.

   #. On **s1-leaf1**, verify the BGP table to ensure the Tenant networks on **s1-leaf4** has been learned in the overlay.

      .. note::

         The output below shows learned **IP Prefix** routes from EVPN. These are referred to as EVPN Type 5 routes. 
         Similar to the Type 2 and 3 Routes, other VTEPs evaluate the **RT** to see if they have a matching 
         configuration and, if so, import the contained prefix into their VRF Route Table. Note that IPv4 and IPv6 
         are supported.

         In the detailed output, we can see the specific routes from **s1-leaf4** by filtering based on the **RD** 
         value. We can see information about the **RT**, EVPN Router MAC (shared with **s1-leaf3**) and the L3 VNI. The 
         highlights below focus on the 10.111.112.0/24 network.

   #. On **s1-leaf1**, check the local ARP and MAC address-table.

      .. note::

         The MAC addresses in your lab may differ as they are randomly generated during the lab build. We see here that 
         the ARP and MAC entry of **s1-host2** has been learned and imported via the Vxlan1 interface on **s1-leaf1** in 
         both Host VLANs.

         We also see the remote MAC for the shared MLAG System ID of **s1-leaf3** and **s1-leaf4** associated with VLAN 
         4093 and the Vxlan1 interface. This is how the local VTEP knows where to send routed (ie inter-subnet) traffic 
         when destined to the remote MLAG pair. We can see this VLAN is dynamically created in the VLAN database and is 
         mapped to our Layer 3 VNI (5001) in our VXLAN interface output. Be aware that since this VLAN is dynamic, the ID 
         used in your lab may be different.

         they have a shared MLAG VTEP IP for VXLAN reachability. Therefore we only see one possible 
         destination for this host MAC. The ``show l2rib output mac <MAC of remote host>`` command then 
         allows us to see the VTEP info in the hardware.  Finally we can verify the ECMP path to the remote 
         MLAG VTEP via **s1-spine1** and **s1-spine2** with a simple ``show ip route 10.111.253.3`` command.

   #. On **s1-leaf1**, verify the Tenant Route table to ensure the Tenant networks on **s1-leaf4** has been installed in the overlay.

      .. note::

         Note on the route table for the TENANT VRF, we see a single route entry for the tenant subnets since they are 
         both locally attached. 

         Also note that the Type 2 MAC-IP Routes, which correspond to the ARP entry of **s1-host2** have also been 
         installed as /32 host routes. This ensures that in a distributed VXLAN fabric, Layer 3 routed traffic is 
         always directed to the VTEP where the host currently resides. This route is directed to the shared MLAG VTEP 
         IP and EVPN Router MAC. It will be ECMPed via the Spines providing a dual path for load-balancing and redundancy.
