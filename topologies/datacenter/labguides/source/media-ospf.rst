Media OSPF Lab
==============

.. image:: images/media-OSPF.png
   :align: center

.. note:: Did you know the OSPF algorithm is considered a link-state protocol, based on the Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm? It is a common protocol used in a number of widely deployed environments in various industries.

1. Log into the **Lab Access** jumpserver:

   1. Type ``media-ospf`` at the prompt. The script will configure the topology with the exception of **Leaf 4**.

   2. On **Spine 2**, verify OSPF operation (it should not be operating correctly) and you will see all the routes currently in the environment.

      All the route entries with a preceding "O" was learned by the OSPF protocol on **Spine 2**.

2. Configure OSPF on the **Leaf 4** switch using the following criteria:

   1. Configure the Ethernet 3, Ethernet 4, Loopback 0 interfaces and the OSPF router process on **Leaf4** to be used for OSPF communication to the adjacent devices (**Spine 2** in this case)

        .. code-block:: text

            configure
            interface loopback 0
              ip address 10.127.255.4/32
            interface ethernet 3
              no switchport
              ip address 10.127.34.4/24
            interface ethernet 4
              no switchport
              ip address 172.16.46.4/24
            router ospf 100
              router-id 10.127.255.4

      **Example:**

         .. code-block:: text

            leaf4#configure
            leaf4(config)#int et 3
            leaf4(config-if-Et3)#no switchport
            leaf4(config-if-Et3)#ip address 10.127.34.4/24
            leaf4(config)#int et 4
            leaf4(config-if-Et4)#no switchport
            leaf4(config-if-Et4)#ip address 172.16.46.4/24
            leaf4(config)#int lo 0
            leaf4(config-if-Lo0)#ip address 10.127.255.4/32
            leaf4(config)#router ospf 100
            leaf4(config-router-ospf)#router-id 10.127.255.4


      .. note::
       All interfaces are point-to-point connections in the OSPF lab, no trunk or access ports

   2. Specify the network statement which encompasses all the interfaces that will take part in the OSPF process.

         .. code-block:: text

            configure
            router ospf 100
               network 10.127.0.0/16 area 0.0.0.0
               network 172.16.46.0/24 area 0.0.0.0

      **Example:**

          .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config)#configure
            leaf4(config)#router ospf 100
            leaf4(config-router-ospf)#network 10.127.0.0/16 area 0.0.0.0
            leaf4(config-router-ospf)#network 172.16.46.0/24 area 0.0.0.0


      .. note::
        All interfaces which fall into the range of the network statement will take part in the OSPF process and listen for and send out hello packets.

   3. Certain interfaces do not need to take part in the OSPF process but we still want the IP's to be advertised out. This is where we leverage the "passive-interface" setting to allow this.  These interfaces will still be associated in the area in which the network statement is associated to.

        .. code-block:: text

            configure
            router ospf 100
              passive interface loopback0
              passive interface ethernet4

      **Example:**

         .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config)#router ospf 100
            leaf4(config-router-ospf)#passive-interface loopback 0
            leaf4(config-router-ospf)#passive-interface ethernet4


   4. Confirm the OSPF neighbor relationship has been established and the routing table on **Leaf 4** has been populated with the appropriate entries.

        .. code-block:: text

            show ip ospf neighbor
            show ip ospf interface
            show ip ospf database
            show ip route

      **Example**

         .. code-block:: text

      The routing table output should list all routing entries in this topology to ensure connectivity.

3. Validate end-to-end connectivity once OSPF neighbor relationship has been established.

   1. Log into **Host 2** and verify connectivity with **Host 1**.

         .. code-block:: text

            enable
            ping 172.16.15.5

      **Example:**

         .. code-block:: text

            host2> enable
            host2# ping 172.16.15.5

      If OSPF settings have been configured correctly and the routing table on **Leaf 4** has converged then **Host 1** should be reachable from **Host 2**.

.. admonition:: **Test your knowledge:**

    When inspecting the routing table on **Leaf 4**, why are all the infrastructure IP address in there? What are the positive and negative results of that?


**LAB COMPLETE!**

.. admonition:: **Helpful Commands:**

    During the lab you can use the different commands to verify connectivity and behaviour for validation and troubleshooting purposes:

   - show ip ospf neighbor
   - show ip ospf interface
   - show ip ospf database
   - show ip route
