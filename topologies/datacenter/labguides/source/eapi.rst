eAPI
====

This lab will walk you through using eAPI through Python. As mentioned
in the previous lab and the presentation, eAPI works through JSON
requests and responses. Fortunately, Python has a module that can handle
that easily!

If you haven’t used Python before, don’t worry! We will break down the
first script to explain how it works, and what it’s doing.

The scripts below leverage ``show`` commands, but you can easily modify them
to issue configuration commands as well - just use what you learned in
the previous lab to do that.

.. note:: While Arista switches have a fully functional Python
          installation, please make sure to use the lab VM for the scripting part of this lab.

Your very first script
----------------------

For the first script, we are going to issue ``show version`` to the switch,
and then print the output.

.. warning:: Please do not start writing this script until you get to the
             next section

The script is the same as in the presentation you just saw:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/python

    from jsonrpclib import Server

    switch = Server ("http://arista:arista@192.168.0.14/command-api")

    response = switch.runCmds( 1, ["show version"] )

    print response

Let’s break down the script into individual pieces:

**#!/usr/bin/python** - this is called a shebang (no, we didn’t make this
up!). A shebang instructs the operating system what to use to run the
script. In this case, python!

**from jsonrpclib import Server** - this imports the Python
submodule ``Server`` from the module ``jsonrpclib``. A Python module extends the
capability of Python by adding additional functionality. There are
Python modules for pretty much everything!

**switch = Server ( "http://arista:arista@192.168.0.14/command-api")**
this instantiates a variable - ``switch`` - and uses the ``Server`` submodule
imported previously to create a connection to the switch. Note that it
uses standard username/password formatting to make the connection.

.. note:: You don’t have to use unencrypted HTTP in production, we also
          work with HTTPS (SSL). For this lab we use HTTP because we don’t want
          to deal with certificates.

**response = switch.runCmds( 1, ["show version"] )** - instantiates a
variable called ``response`` - that uses the previously
created ``switch.runCmds`` variable to run commands. This is where it starts
getting interesting. 

Once we create the ``switch`` connection, ``runCmds`` is the method provided by
theswitch’s JSON-RPC interface which allows us to run commands against
it. As a part of ``runCmds``, we also expect an API version (1) and the
command itself, in this case ``show version``.

If you rewind and go back to the Command API Explorer, you would see
that in the **Request Viewer** pane:

   :align: center

Note the ``method``, ``cmds``, and ``version`` keys!

.. note:: The other values, such as format, timestamps, and id are
          defaults and do not need to be specified in your request.

**print response** - finally, we print the ``response`` variable to screen.

Write it
~~~~~~~~

Now that’s out of the way, it’s time to actually write the code! If you
are still connected to **leaf1**, connect back to **devbox**.

.. note:: To switch between your switch and the desktop, press **Ctrl + Alt +Shift**, 
          click **arista** at the top right of the menu, click **Home**, and then
          double click **devbox**. To switch back, reverse the process.

We have installed the very popular code editor called Atom on your lab
machine. It can be launched with the green sphere like icon on the
taskbar:

.. image:: images/eapi_2.png
   :align: center

Open **Atom** and write in the code above. Alternatively, if you’d just like
to paste in the code, hit **Ctrl-Alt-Shift** and paste it into
the **Clipboard** box. Then you can paste it right into Atom by right
clicking on the screen and selecting paste:

.. note:: To close the sidebar window, press **Ctrl-Alt-Shift** again.

.. image:: images/eapi_3.png
   :align: center

Once done, save the file to your desktop.

Run it
~~~~~~

Now, let’s run it! On your lab box, click on the Terminal icon in the
taskbar:

.. image:: images/eapi_4.png
   :align: center

A terminal window will open. Run your script by entering:

.. code-block:: bash

    python ~/Desktop/your_script_name_here

If this doesn’t work, make sure you replaced ``your_script_name_here`` with
the filename of the script you saved above!

.. note:: For the more Linux savvy folks, you might wonder why we’re
          calling Python directly instead of relying on the aforementioned
          shebang (``#!/usr/bin/python``) - if you want to make the file executable
          go for it!

.. image:: images/eapi_5.png
   :align: center

Woohoo - check out that JSON!

.. note:: The “u” in front of every key/value indicates it’s unicode. When
          you actually use the key/value, this will not appear.

Advanced
--------

So that was cool and all, but if you want to take it one step further,
check out the following script - this time we’re taking the output and
doing something with it:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/python

    from jsonrpclib import Server

    switch = Server ("http://arista:arista@192.168.0.14/command-api")

    response = switch.runCmds( 1, ["show version"] )

    print "The switch model name is " + response[0]["modelName"] + " and it is running " + response[0]["version"]

There are plenty of other possibilities here. Think about your day to
day operations and things that you have to do frequently that take a lot
of time, but are tedious and error prone. Any Python script that can be
run against one switch can be run against many more. Adding a VLAN to
every switch in your datacenter might just involve providing a list of
switch hostnames or IP addresses, a VLAN ID, and a name and your script
will do it all for you!

Another script idea is tracing a MAC across your network until you find
the physical port it’s connected to. The possibilities are only limited
by your imagination. This is about as close
to\  `zombo.com <http://www.zombo.com>`__ as
you can get in the networking world!

Bonus
-----

Print the response of ``show version`` using `PrettyPrint <https://docs.python.org/2/library/pprint.html>`__\ .
