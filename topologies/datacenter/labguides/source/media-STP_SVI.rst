.. note:: The Spanning-Tree protocol (STP) was initially invented in 1985 and is one of the oldest networking protocols being used in Layer 2 network topologies today. STP is classified as a network protocol that builds loop-free logical topology for Ethernet (initially bridged) networks.

1. Log into the **LabAccess** jumpserver:

   1. Type ``media-vlan`` at the prompt. The script will configure the topology with the exception of **Leaf 4**.

   2. On **Spine 2**, verify spanning-tree operation with the topology, you should see **Spine 1** as the root bridge by viewing the Bridge ID and the interfaces designated as a Root port.  Root ports points towards the root bridge, which in this case would be Spine 1.  When you run the following command which interfaces would you expect to be your root port(s)?

            Et7              designated forwarding 2000      128.7    P2p Edge

2. Configure the VLAN and interface types on **Leaf 4** to allow the spanning-tree protocol to operate and have reachability for **Host 2**.


   1. On **Leaf 4** create the Layer 2 instance of vlan 100. Creating this vlan will add itself to the spanning-tree process.

        .. code-block:: text

            configure
            vlan 100
                name v100

      **Example:**

        .. code-block:: text

            leaf4#configure
            leaf4(config)#vlan 100
            leaf4(config-vlan-100)#name v100

      We can verify its creation with the following command.  This command can also show if there are any physical interfaces associated to the vlan.

        .. code-block:: text

             show vlan

      **Example:**

        .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config-vlan-100)#show vlan
            VLAN  Name                             Status    Ports
            ----- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
            1     default                          active    Et2, Et3, Et4, Et6, Et7, Et8
                                                             Et9, Et10, Et11, Et12, Et13
                                                             Et14, Et15, Et16, Et17, Et18
                                                             Et19, Et20, Et21, Et22, Et23
                                                             Et24, Et25, Et26, Et27, Et28
                                                             Et29, Et30, Et31, Et32
            12    VLAN0012                         active
            34    VLAN0034                         active
            100   v100                             active



   2. Once the vlan is created, we can define on the uplink ports on **Leaf 4** as trunk links, as well allow vlan 100 to pass on the trunk.

        .. code-block:: text

            configure
            interface Ethernet2
              switchport trunk allowed vlan 100
              switchport mode trunk
            !
            interface Ethernet3
              switchport trunk allowed vlan 100
              switchport mode trunk
            !

      **Example:**

        .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config-vlan-100)#configure
            leaf4(config)#interface ethernet 2-3
            leaf4(config-if-Et2-3)#switchport mode trunk
            leaf4(config-if-Et2-3)#switchport trunk allowed vlan 100

      .. note::
        By default once an interface is configured as a trunk, all vlans will be associated to it. It is good security practice to associate the specific vlans to pass on the trunk links and take part in the spanning-tree process

      Once the interface configuration has been completed for the trunk links, you can verify the spanning-tree topology and see the root bridge is **Spine 1** and the connection to **Spine 2** has been blocked for loop prevention

        .. code-block:: text

            show spanning-tree

      **Example:**

        .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config-if-Et2-3)#show spanning-tree

            Et10             designated forwarding 2000      128.10   P2p Edge


   3. Once the Layer 2 topology has been setup, we can configure the connection to our host as an access port to allow **Host 2** to pass traffic onto the topology

        .. code-block:: text

            configure
            interface Ethernet4
              switchport access vlan 100

      **Example:**

        .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config-if-Et2-3)#configure
            leaf4(config)#interface ethernet 4
            leaf4(config-if-Et4)#switchport access vlan 100

3. Validate end-to-end connectivity after configuring the Layer 2 interfaces. Once the spanning tree has converged for the topology we can observe the results.

   1. Validate the vlan port association and spanning-tree topology is correct

        .. code-block:: text

            show vlan
            show spanning-tree

      **Example:**

        .. code-block:: text

            leaf4(config-if-Et4)#show vlan
            VLAN  Name                             Status    Ports

    You should see the root bridge is towards **Spine 1** and vlan 100 should be associated to interfaces eth2, eth3 and eth4

   2. Log into **Host 2** and verify you can reach the SVI for vlan 100 as well as reachability to **Host 1**

 .. admonition:: **Test your knowledge:**

    When you are verifying the spanning-tree topology from **Leaf 4**, what are some of the reasons for the root bridge selection?


**LAB COMPLETE!**

.. admonition:: **Helpful Commands:**

    During the lab you can use the different commands to verify connectivity and behaviour for validation and troubleshooting purposes:

   - show vlan
   - show interfaces trunk
   - show interfaces status
   - show spanning-tree
