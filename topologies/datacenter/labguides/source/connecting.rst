Connecting
==========

1. Log into the Arista Test Drive portal with your assigned URL. If you
   don’t have one, please see your ATD staff.

2. SSH to the public address assigned to the LabAccess jumphost server (this is the Topology Address shown in the "Welcome to Arista's Test Drive!" picture above). The username is ``arista`` and the password is ``{REPLACE_PWD}``:

    .. code-block:: text

       ssh arista@{unique_address}.topo.testdrive.arista.com

3. The LabAccess menu allows users to connect to each device and specify
   lab topology. It is recommended to open multiple SSH sessions or use
   the Screen option (under the SSH Menu) to jump between devices rapidly.

   You can also Access the LabAccess Menu from your browser by clicking on `Console Access`
