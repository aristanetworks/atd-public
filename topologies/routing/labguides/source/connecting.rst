2. SSH to the public IP address assigned to the LabAccess jumphost server (this is the IP address shown in the "Welcome to Arista's
   Demo Cloud" picture above). The username is ``arista`` and the password is ``{REPLACE_PWD}``:

    .. code-block:: text

       ssh arista@x.x.x.x

3. The LabAccess menu allows users to connect to each device and specify
   lab topology. It is recommended to open multiple SSH sessions or use
   the Screen option to jump between devices rapidly.
