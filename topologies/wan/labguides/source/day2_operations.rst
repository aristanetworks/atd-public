Day 2 Operations
========================

If you recall the earlier presentation, we mentioned Continuous
Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD). Now we’re going to show
you an example.

In this lab, we’re going to go from 0-60 pretty quickly and introduce a
couple of new tools. We’re also going to do things a little bit
differently - we’re going to modify multiple switches simultaneously.

Tools used in this lab
----------------------

`Git <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://git-scm.com/&sa=D&ust=1523980190033000>`__\  is
the most popular version control system. If you are familiar with SVN
(Subversion) or CVS, it is a more modern and distributed system. Git
keeps your source code/configurations in a repository (repo) and
maintains a record of what changed and by whom.

.. note:: Git is an incredibly powerful tool. We’re using shortcuts that
          are specific to this lab. When using Git in production - or even just
          for fun - please ensure you understand the commands you are
          using. Some Git commands are destructive and irreversible!

`Jenkins <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jenkins.io/&sa=D&ust=1523980190034000>`__\  is
one of the most popular open-source automation tools with hundreds of
plugins for building/deploying/automating pretty much anything. It’s not
outside the realm of possibility to have it test and push changes to
your switches and then order you a pizza if it’s successful.

Git commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This lab makes use of a handful of git commands and the table below
describes their function:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Making a change
---------------

Our tried and true “add a VLAN” task is back in full force for this lab,
but with a twist. We're going to set up the usual suspects - a hosts
file and a playbook, but this time we will also use group variables.
Group variables are similar to the variables defined within your
playbook in Lab #4 and #5 but can be consumed by a group of hosts,
not just the play’s target.

This is particularly useful for things like adding a VLAN where you
typically want to add the VLAN to multiple devices at the same time.

Write it
~~~~~~~~

This lab is broken into steps.

Step #1: Hosts File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let’s start out with a different-looking hosts file, this time with
every one of your leaf switches in it. Take special note of ``[leafs]`` -
we’ll be using this later.

Open the **Programmability IDE**, and create the file below:

.. code-block:: ini

    [leafs]
    192.168.0.12
    192.168.0.13
    192.168.0.14
    192.168.0.15

**Save** the file with the name ``hosts`` into the ``/home/coder/project/labfiles/lab6/lab`` folder.

.. note:: You will notice that there are existing files and folders.
          Please don’t overwrite anything for this lab.

Step #2: Playbook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The playbook is different from the other labs; we’re going to call a
pre-created role that is provided by Arista on \ `Ansible
Galaxy <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://galaxy.ansible.com/&sa=D&ust=1523980190043000>`__\ .

Ansible Galaxy is a website where individuals and organizations can
freely share their roles with each other. In this case, we’ll be using
the ``arista.eos.eos_vlans`` module from the ``arista.eos`` Ansible Collection to add VLANs.

In the **IDE**, create the file below:

.. code-block:: ini

    - hosts: leafs
      connection: local
      tasks:
      - name: Create vlans
        arista.eos.eos_vlans:
          config:
          - vlan_id: "{{ item.vlanid }}"
            name: "{{ item.name }}"
          state: overridden
        loop: "{{ vlans }}"


Save the file with the name ``vlan.yml`` into the ``/home/coder/project/labfiles/lab6/lab`` folder.

Step #3: Group Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now we’re going to mix it up a bit. We used ``vars:`` in previous labs
and only acted against a single host. This time around,
we will be using what is called group variables. Group variables
are used for groups of hosts and not individuals.

Remember how in the hosts file above we started with ``[leafs]``? If we
create a group variable file named ``leafs.yml``, Ansible will automagically
use it for the hosts listed below ``[leafs]``!

Some more things to know about the file below:

#. Notice that we’re using the Ansible Collections methodology and approach for this lab.
#. ``vlans``, ``vlan_id``, and ``name`` are what the ``arista.eos.eos_vlans`` collections module take as an
   input. If you want to see every module and variable that the collection can use, see
   the \ `readme for the
   role <https://github.com/ansible-collections/arista.eos>`__\ .

In the **IDE**, and create the file below:

.. code-block:: ini


    ansible_connection: ansible.netcommon.httpapi
    ansible_httpapi_use_ssl: True
    ansible_httpapi_validate_certs: False
    ansible_network_os: arista.eos.eos
    ansible_user: arista
    ansible_password: {REPLACE_PWD}
    vlans:
     - vlanid: 1001
       name: default


Save the file with the name ``leafs.yml`` into
the ``/home/coder/project/labfiles/lab6/lab/group_vars`` folder.

Step #4: Jenkins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go back to the ATD web landing page, and click on the **Jenkins** link:

Once Jenkins has loaded, click on the **Login** link for access with:

Username: ``arista`` Password: ``{REPLACE_PWD}``

.. image:: images/day2/nested_jenkins_1.png
   :align: center

|

Jenkins will open in a new tab. Click on **New Item** in the top left of
the window.

You will be greeted with a screen like the one below. Enter **vlan** as the
name and select **Freestyle project**.

.. image:: images/day2/nested_jenkins_2.png
   :align: center

Click **OK**.

Now comes the fun part.

Under **Source Code Management**, check **Git** and
enter ``/opt/labfiles/lab6/repo`` in the **Repository URL** field.

.. note:: You will see a warning, ignore it for now.

Scroll down to **Build Triggers**, and check **Poll SCM**. Poll SCM will poll for
changes in Git and trigger a build from it.

.. note:: This is a crucial aspect of continuous delivery - once a change is made, this is the part that deploys it.

In the **Schedule** field, enter in:

.. code-block:: html

    * * * * *

If you are familiar with Linux cron, this is the same format - it’s
telling Jenkins to check every 1 minute for a change.

Scroll down to **Build** and click on **Add build step**. Select **Invoke Ansible Playbook**.

For **Playbook path**, enter ``vlan.yml``. Select **File** or **host list** and enter
in ``hosts``.

Click **Save**.

Step #5: Git
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have to commit our changes into a Git repository for Jenkins to
detect a change and run our playbook. Let’s go back to our **IDE** and run
a few of quick commands for our initial commit.

Open a **terminal** window and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/project/labfiles/lab6/lab

First we will need to prep our "remote" git repository. Type the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    git init --bare /home/coder/project/labfiles/lab6/repo

Now enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin /home/coder/project/labfiles/lab6/repo
    git push origin master

Run it
~~~~~~

Phew, that was a lot of setup! Fortunately, unlike previous labs, we’re
not going to be running this one by hand - that wouldn’t be CI/CD! Instead
We’re going to use Jenkins to run the playbook.

At a high level, the workflow of the “Run it” part of the lab looks like
this:

.. image:: images/day2/nested_jenkins_3.png
   :align: center

Let’s start with Step 1.

Step #1: Add a VLAN to the variables file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the ``leafs.yml`` variables file in the **IDE**.

Add the following highlighted lines directly below the existing text:

.. code-block:: ini

    vlans:
     - vlanid: 1001
       name: default
     - vlanid: 2000
       name: production
     - vlanid: 3000
       name: development

**Save** the file.

Step #2: Add the file to the Git commit and push it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, let’s add the file, commit, and push it. If you want to see it run,
we’ll need to act quickly here, so get ready!

In the **terminal** window, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/project/labfiles/lab6/lab

Now enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    git add .
    git commit -m "Added VLAN 2000 and 3000"
    git push origin master

Quickly, open Jenkins!

Step #3: Jenkins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will see different things depending on how fast you switched to
Jenkins. For example, if you were quick, you will see this:

.. image:: images/day2/nested_jenkins_4.png
   :align: center

See the **vlan** build running? No worries if you weren’t able to see it,
Jenkins keeps a history - handy for when you want to see how things
went.

From the main screen, click on **vlan**:

.. image:: images/day2/nested_jenkins_5.png
   :align: center

On the left hand side, click on the latest build which should be **#3**, but
could be a higher or lower number.

.. image:: images/day2/nested_jenkins_6.png
   :align: center

In the left hand menu, click **Console Output**.  Scroll all the way to the
bottom to see:

.. code-block:: html

    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    192.168.0.12               : ok=7    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=2    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.0.13               : ok=7    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=2    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.0.14               : ok=7    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=2    rescued=0    ignored=0
    192.168.0.15               : ok=7    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=2    rescued=0    ignored=0

Woot, sweet success!

Step #4: Switches are configured
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, log into a couple of the leaf switches for the final step. Notice
the VLANs are there. Pretty cool, huh?

You can do this for 1 or 1000 switches using this playbook.
